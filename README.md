# 🎤 boom-box

**Not Loom, but better... maybe? I don't know.** 🤷‍♂️

A quirky Electron app that lets you record your screen with style. Think of it as Loom's rebellious younger sibling who decided to go their own way and ended up being... well, we'll let you decide if it's better or not.

## ✨ Features

### 🎥 Screen Recording
- Record your entire screen (yes, the WHOLE thing)
- Automatically excludes the main boom-box window (because who wants to see their own controls?)
- Saves recordings to `Downloads/boom-box` (organized chaos, amirite?)

### 📹 Camera Overlay
- A draggable, resizable circular camera window that follows you around (or you follow it, we're not judging)
- Position it anywhere on your screen like a digital pet
- Always stays on top because it's needy like that

### 🎨 Background Blur
- Blur your background using MediaPipe's magic (because your messy room is nobody's business)
- Toggle it on/off with a single click
- Works in real-time because we're fancy like that

### 🎤 Audio Magic
- Select from available microphones (because one mic is never enough)
- 300% volume boost (for when you want to be heard across the universe)
- Advanced audio processing:
  - Echo cancellation (no more weird echoes)
  - Noise suppression (goodbye keyboard clicks)
  - Auto gain control (because consistency is key)
  - Compressor (for that professional touch)

### 🎛️ Controls
- Record button (starts/stops recording, pretty standard stuff)
- Play/Pause toggle (because sometimes you need a break)
- Microphone selector (choose your weapon)
- Camera selector (because variety is the spice of life)
- Background blur toggle (hide your secrets)

### 🔄 Auto-Refresh
- Device lists automatically update when you plug/unplug devices
- No manual refresh needed (we're not savages)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (because we're not living in the stone age)
- npm (Node's package manager, obviously)

### Installation

1. Clone this repo (or download it, we're not picky):
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd boom-box
```

2. Install dependencies (this might take a minute, grab a coffee ☕):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the app (the moment of truth):
```bash
npm start
```

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see the main boom-box window in the top-right corner (it's shy, so it hides there)

2. **Select your devices** - Choose your microphone and camera from the dropdowns (they auto-select defaults, because we're helpful like that)

3. **Position your camera** - The circular camera window appears in the bottom-left. Drag it wherever you want (it's your world, we're just living in it)

4. **Toggle blur** - Click the "Background Blur" checkbox if you want to hide your laundry pile

5. **Start recording** - Click "Record" and watch the magic happen (or don't, since the main window won't be in the recording anyway)

6. **Pause/Resume** - Use the "Pause" button if you need to take a break (we all need breaks)

7. **Stop recording** - Click "Record" again to stop. Your masterpiece will be saved to `Downloads/boom-box`

## 🎨 Customization

The app features a sleek black theme because we're edgy like that. The scrollbar is styled to match (because details matter).

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Sometimes the camera window gets a bit too attached (always on top, remember?)
- The main window might be a bit small (we're working on it, okay?)
- Background blur might make you look like a ghost (it's a feature, not a bug)
